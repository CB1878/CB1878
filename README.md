- 👋 Hi, I’m @CB1878
- 👀 I’m interested in learning full stack development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning using The Odin Project
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything, irl I have plenty of experience in manufacturing, basic design, team leadership, 
      and problem solving. I guess time will tell if that will expand to coding!
- 📫 How to reach me, for now you can reach me through github. I'll add more ways to contact me in the future as I become more involved in the community.
